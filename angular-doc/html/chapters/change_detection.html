        <p>To understand how this works, we need to start by realizing that in Javascript the whole runtime is overridable by design. We can override functions in String or Number if we so want.</p>
        <p>What happens is that Angular at startup time will patch several low-level browser APIs, such as for example addEventListener, which is the browser function used to register all browser events, including click handlers. Angular will replace addEventListener with a new version that does the equivalent of this:</p>
        <div class="row flex-center">
            <img class="no-border" src="./../assets/images/angular_patch_avantListerner.PNG" alt="angular_patch_avantListerner">
        </div>
        <p>The new version of addEventListener adds more functionality to any event handler: not only the registered callback is called, but Angular is given a chance to run change detection and update the UI.</p>
        <p>This low-level patching of browser APIs is done by a library shipped with Angular called Zone.js. It's important to have an idea of what a zone is.</p>
        <p>A zone is nothing more than an execution context that survives multiple Javascript VM execution turns. It's a generic mechanism which we can use to add extra functionality to the browser. Angular uses Zones internally to trigger change detection, but another possible use would be to do application profiling, or keeping track of long stack traces that run across multiple VM turns.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The following frequently used browser mechanisms are patched to support change detection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All browser events (click, mouseover, keyup, etc.)</li>
            <li>setTimeout() and setInterval()</li>
            <li>Ajax HTTP requests</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In fact, many other browser APIs are patched by Zone.js to transparently trigger Angular change detection, such as for example Websockets.</p>
        <p>One limitation of this mechanism is that if by some reason an asynchronous browser API is not supported by Zone.js, then change detection will not be triggered. This is, for example, the case of IndexedDB callbacks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Each Angular component has an associated change detector, which is created at application startup time. The compoenent tree could be seen as a change detector tree</p>

            <li><a href="./../index.html">Angular</a></li>
            <li><a href="./change_detection.html">Change detection !</a></li>

        <p>This method might look strange at first. But it's doing something very simple: for each expression used in the template, it's comparing the current value of the property used in the expression with the previous value of that property.</p>
        <p>If the property value before and after is different, it will set isChanged to true, and that's it! Well almost, it's comparing values by using a method called looseNotIdentical(), which is really just a === comparison with special logic for the NaN case </p>
        <p>With this, we can safely say that:</p>
        <i style="margin-left: 2rem;">By default, Angular Change Detection works by checking if the value of template expressions have changed. This is done for all components.</i>
        <p>We can also conclude that:</p>
        <i style="margin-left: 2rem;">By default, Angular does not do deep object comparison to detect changes, it only takes into account properties used by the template</i>
        <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">One of the main goals of Angular is to be more transparent and easy to use, so that framework users don't have to go through great lengths to debug the framework and be aware of internal mechanisms in order to be able to use it effectively.</p>
        <i style="margin-left: 2rem;">The fact of the matter is that Javascript objects are mutable, and Angular wants to give full support out of the box for those.</i>
        <p>Imagine what it would be if the Angular default change detection mechanism would be based on reference comparison of component inputs instead of the default mechanism? Even something as simple as a TODO application would be tricky to build: developers would have to be very careful to create a new Todo instead of simply updating properties.</p>
        <p>But if we run into a performance corner case, there a way to optimize change detection</p>
